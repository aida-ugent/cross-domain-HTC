# Cross-domainHierarchical Text Classification Benchmark

This folder contains the code and instructions accompanying our paper "Your Next State-of-the-Art Could Come from Another Domain: A Cross-Domain Analysis of Hierarchical Text Classification".

## Structure

Each method is contained in its own directory with accompanying documentation:
- Method 1
- Method 2
- ...

## Evaluation

For consistent evaluation across all methods:
1. Save raw prediction scores from your model
2. Use [PECOS](https://github.com/amzn/pecos) to calculate standardized metrics

## TODO

Further clean up the code, coming soon.
